# Smoke Alarm Operator Console

A React + TypeScript operator console for planning routes, recording visits, and sending invoices.

## Quick start
```bash
./scripts/launch_gui.sh
```

The script installs dependencies, starts the development server, and attempts to create a desktop shortcut for quick access. It also binds the server to your network interface and prints a URL you can open on your phone.

## Testing
```bash
cd gui
npm test
```
