# Evaluation of Scrapy Repository

## Licensing and Reuse
- Scrapy is released under the BSD license, allowing reuse with minimal restrictions as long as the license notice is retained.
- Any copied code must keep the original copyright notice and disclaimers.

## Potential Value Additions
- **Web scraping engine**: Scrapy offers a production-grade crawling and scraping framework built on Twisted, which can help us gather property or compliance data from external websites.
- **Item pipelines**: Built-in data processing pipelines could streamline data validation and transformation before inserting records into our Sheets or database.
- **Extensible architecture**: Signals, middlewares, and extensions make it easy to customize scraping behavior and integrate with our existing routing agent.
- **Robust testing and tooling**: The project includes extensive unit tests and command-line tools that we can mirror to improve reliability in our own agent.

## Proposed Next Steps
1. Add `scrapy` as an optional dependency in `pyproject.toml` for modules that need web scraping.
2. Prototype a minimal spider for retrieving publicly available property information.
3. Evaluate Scrapy's middleware pattern for potential use in our data processing flows.
4. Incorporate Scrapy's testing practices to bolster our unit test coverage.

These changes can be reviewed and implemented incrementally to enhance our data acquisition capabilities.
