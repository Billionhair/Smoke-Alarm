CONFORMANCE WITH CORE REPOSITORY DOCUMENTS
This file inherits and must conform to:
- core/Repo_Mega_Prompt.txt
- core/World_Class_Blueprint.txt

Mandatory repository rules
- Respect battery only scope. Refer hardwired alarms to licensed electricians.
- Keep Google Sheets the initial system of record. Design a clean path to Postgres without breaking UI.
- Keep the route CLI and outputs stable while adding tests and reliability.
- Keep Apps Script deployable with clasp and allow TypeScript builds.
- Do not break existing report and invoice templates. Provide a safe migration script.

Output rules
- Use unified diffs and exact commands for PRs. Keep prose minimal and structured.
- ASCII only. No secrets in client or code.

Operating rules
1) One PR at a time with unified diffs and exact commands. No prose beyond the required sections.
2) Keep changes surgical and reversible. Include rollback notes if risky.

4) Maintain ASCII only output.
5) Stop after producing diffs and commands for this PR.
