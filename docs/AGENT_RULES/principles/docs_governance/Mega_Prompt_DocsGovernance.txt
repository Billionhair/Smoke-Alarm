CONFORMANCE WITH CORE REPOSITORY DOCUMENTS
This file inherits and must conform to:
- core/Repo_Mega_Prompt.txt
- core/World_Class_Blueprint.txt

Mandatory repository rules
- Respect battery only scope. Refer hardwired alarms to licensed electricians.
- Keep Google Sheets the initial system of record. Design a clean path to Postgres without breaking UI.
- Keep the route CLI and outputs stable while adding tests and reliability.
- Keep Apps Script deployable with clasp and allow TypeScript builds.
- Do not break existing report and invoice templates. Provide a safe migration script.

Output rules
- Use unified diffs and exact commands for PRs. Keep prose minimal and structured.
- ASCII only. No secrets in client or code.

DOCS_GOVERNANCE - MEGA PROMPT
Date: 2025-09-03

Scope
Create world class docs, contribution rules, support and security policies, and a minimal docs site.

Inheritance
- Read ../core/Repo_Mega_Prompt.txt and ../core/World_Class_Blueprint.txt first.
- Apply constraints, SLOs, and security rules. This prompt takes precedence where more specific.
- Respect Google Sheets as the initial system of record and keep the path open for Postgres.

Operating rules
1) One PR at a time with unified diffs and exact commands. No prose beyond the required sections.
2) Keep changes surgical and reversible. Include rollback notes if risky.
3) No secrets in client or code. Use environment variables and Script Properties.
4) Maintain ASCII only output.
5) Stop after producing diffs and commands for this PR.

Deliverables
- README, CONTRIBUTING, CODEOWNERS, SECURITY, SUPPORT
- Issue and PR templates
- Docs site skeleton with navigation

Task routing within this principle
- Quickstart and troubleshooting
- Contribution workflow
- Security reporting and SLAs

PR plan
- PR 1: Rewrite README with 60 second quickstart and troubleshooting
- PR 2: Add CONTRIBUTING, CODEOWNERS, SECURITY, SUPPORT, issue templates
- PR 3: Add docs site skeleton

Acceptance gates
- New devs onboard in under 1 day
- Security contact and SLA visible
- Docs site builds locally

KPIs and budgets
- Reduced support questions
- Faster onboarding time

Risks and rollback
- Docs rot. Mitigate with owner assignment
- Over complex site. Mitigate with minimal static generator

Output format the agent must follow
- Section A: PR title and rationale
- Section B: Files changed list
- Section C: Unified diff
- Section D: Commands to apply and to run checks
- Section E: Rollback steps
- Section F: Acceptance checks to verify

Defaults when information is missing
- Choose best practice defaults from the core blueprint and prompts.
- Prefer reversible changes. Provide options when in doubt.
