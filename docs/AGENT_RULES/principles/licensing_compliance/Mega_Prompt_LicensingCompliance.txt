CONFORMANCE WITH CORE REPOSITORY DOCUMENTS
This file inherits and must conform to:
- core/Repo_Mega_Prompt.txt
- core/World_Class_Blueprint.txt

Mandatory repository rules
- Respect battery only scope. Refer hardwired alarms to licensed electricians.
- Keep Google Sheets the initial system of record. Design a clean path to Postgres without breaking UI.
- Keep the route CLI and outputs stable while adding tests and reliability.
- Keep Apps Script deployable with clasp and allow TypeScript builds.
- Do not break existing report and invoice templates. Provide a safe migration script.

Output rules
- Use unified diffs and exact commands for PRs. Keep prose minimal and structured.
- ASCII only. No secrets in client or code.

LICENSING_COMPLIANCE - MEGA PROMPT
Date: 2025-09-03

Scope
Select license, scan dependencies, and document third party obligations with SBOM per release.

Inheritance
- Read ../core/Repo_Mega_Prompt.txt and ../core/World_Class_Blueprint.txt first.
- Apply constraints, SLOs, and security rules. This prompt takes precedence where more specific.
- Respect Google Sheets as the initial system of record and keep the path open for Postgres.

Operating rules
1) One PR at a time with unified diffs and exact commands. No prose beyond the required sections.
2) Keep changes surgical and reversible. Include rollback notes if risky.
3) No secrets in client or code. Use environment variables and Script Properties.
4) Maintain ASCII only output.
5) Stop after producing diffs and commands for this PR.

Deliverables
- LICENSE file with SPDX id
- SBOM generation and license scan job
- Third party attribution doc

Task routing within this principle
- License selection and notices
- Dependency scanning and review
- Attribution generation

PR plan
- PR 1: Add LICENSE and NOTICE
- PR 2: Add SBOM and license scan to CI
- PR 3: Add third party attribution doc and release packaging

Acceptance gates
- LICENSE present and SPDX used
- No forbidden licenses
- Attribution doc in releases

KPIs and budgets
- SBOM per release
- Zero unresolved high risk license issues

Risks and rollback
- False positives. Mitigate with allow list policy
- Unlicensed code. Mitigate with scans and reviews

Output format the agent must follow
- Section A: PR title and rationale
- Section B: Files changed list
- Section C: Unified diff
- Section D: Commands to apply and to run checks
- Section E: Rollback steps
- Section F: Acceptance checks to verify

Defaults when information is missing
- Choose best practice defaults from the core blueprint and prompts.
- Prefer reversible changes. Provide options when in doubt.
