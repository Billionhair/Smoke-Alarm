CONFORMANCE WITH CORE REPOSITORY DOCUMENTS
This file inherits and must conform to:
- core/Repo_Mega_Prompt.txt
- core/World_Class_Blueprint.txt

Mandatory repository rules
- Respect battery only scope. Refer hardwired alarms to licensed electricians.
- Keep Google Sheets the initial system of record. Design a clean path to Postgres without breaking UI.
- Keep the route CLI and outputs stable while adding tests and reliability.
- Keep Apps Script deployable with clasp and allow TypeScript builds.
- Do not break existing report and invoice templates. Provide a safe migration script.

Output rules
- Use unified diffs and exact commands for PRs. Keep prose minimal and structured.
- ASCII only. No secrets in client or code.

A11Y_I18N - MEGA PROMPT
Date: 2025-09-03

Scope
Deliver AA accessibility and localizable UI with RTL safe layouts and proper semantics.

Inheritance
- Read ../core/Repo_Mega_Prompt.txt and ../core/World_Class_Blueprint.txt first.
- Apply constraints, SLOs, and security rules. This prompt takes precedence where more specific.
- Respect Google Sheets as the initial system of record and keep the path open for Postgres.

Operating rules
1) One PR at a time with unified diffs and exact commands. No prose beyond the required sections.
2) Keep changes surgical and reversible. Include rollback notes if risky.
3) No secrets in client or code. Use environment variables and Script Properties.
4) Maintain ASCII only output.
5) Stop after producing diffs and commands for this PR.

Deliverables
- Keyboard nav and focus management
- Screen reader labels and landmarks
- Externalized strings and RTL checks

Task routing within this principle
- Keyboard, focus, and shortcuts
- ARIA roles and labels
- Locale files and RTL

PR plan
- PR 1: Keyboard and focus pass on core flows
- PR 2: Add ARIA labels and landmarks
- PR 3: Externalize strings to translation files and verify RTL

Acceptance gates
- Lighthouse accessibility 95 plus
- Screen reader audit passes
- RTL renders without breakage

KPIs and budgets
- Zero critical a11y issues
- All core flows usable by keyboard only

Risks and rollback
- Focus traps. Mitigate with audits and tests
- String mismatches. Mitigate with linting and CI checks

Output format the agent must follow
- Section A: PR title and rationale
- Section B: Files changed list
- Section C: Unified diff
- Section D: Commands to apply and to run checks
- Section E: Rollback steps
- Section F: Acceptance checks to verify

Defaults when information is missing
- Choose best practice defaults from the core blueprint and prompts.
- Prefer reversible changes. Provide options when in doubt.
