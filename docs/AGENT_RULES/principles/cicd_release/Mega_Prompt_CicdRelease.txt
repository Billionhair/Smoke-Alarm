CONFORMANCE WITH CORE REPOSITORY DOCUMENTS
This file inherits and must conform to:
- core/Repo_Mega_Prompt.txt
- core/World_Class_Blueprint.txt

Mandatory repository rules
- Respect battery only scope. Refer hardwired alarms to licensed electricians.
- Keep Google Sheets the initial system of record. Design a clean path to Postgres without breaking UI.
- Keep the route CLI and outputs stable while adding tests and reliability.
- Keep Apps Script deployable with clasp and allow TypeScript builds.
- Do not break existing report and invoice templates. Provide a safe migration script.

Output rules
- Use unified diffs and exact commands for PRs. Keep prose minimal and structured.
- ASCII only. No secrets in client or code.

CICD_RELEASE - MEGA PROMPT
Date: 2025-09-03

Scope
Create CI jobs and release policy with semantic versioning and changelog automation.

Inheritance
- Read ../core/Repo_Mega_Prompt.txt and ../core/World_Class_Blueprint.txt first.
- Apply constraints, SLOs, and security rules. This prompt takes precedence where more specific.
- Respect Google Sheets as the initial system of record and keep the path open for Postgres.

Operating rules
1) One PR at a time with unified diffs and exact commands. No prose beyond the required sections.
2) Keep changes surgical and reversible. Include rollback notes if risky.
3) No secrets in client or code. Use environment variables and Script Properties.
4) Maintain ASCII only output.
5) Stop after producing diffs and commands for this PR.

Deliverables
- GitHub Actions workflows for agent and gui
- Release job with semantic versioning and changelog
- Optional preview environments

Task routing within this principle
- Lint, typecheck, test stages
- Release tagging and artifacts
- Preview builds

PR plan
- PR 1: Actions for lint, typecheck, test for agent and gui
- PR 2: Semantic release job and changelog
- PR 3: PR previews for gui when budget allows

Acceptance gates
- Required checks enforced on main
- Releases tagged with changelog and artifacts

KPIs and budgets
- CI success over 95 percent
- Lead time to deploy under 1 day

Risks and rollback
- Secrets for releases. Mitigate with OIDC and repo environments
- Long builds. Mitigate with caching and matrix

Output format the agent must follow
- Section A: PR title and rationale
- Section B: Files changed list
- Section C: Unified diff
- Section D: Commands to apply and to run checks
- Section E: Rollback steps
- Section F: Acceptance checks to verify

Defaults when information is missing
- Choose best practice defaults from the core blueprint and prompts.
- Prefer reversible changes. Provide options when in doubt.
