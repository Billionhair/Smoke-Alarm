CONFORMANCE WITH CORE REPOSITORY DOCUMENTS
This file inherits and must conform to:
- core/Repo_Mega_Prompt.txt
- core/World_Class_Blueprint.txt

Mandatory repository rules
- Respect battery only scope. Refer hardwired alarms to licensed electricians.
- Keep Google Sheets the initial system of record. Design a clean path to Postgres without breaking UI.
- Keep the route CLI and outputs stable while adding tests and reliability.
- Keep Apps Script deployable with clasp and allow TypeScript builds.
- Do not break existing report and invoice templates. Provide a safe migration script.

Output rules
- Use unified diffs and exact commands for PRs. Keep prose minimal and structured.
- ASCII only. No secrets in client or code.

DEVEX - MEGA PROMPT
Date: 2025-09-03

Scope
Improve developer speed with pre-commit, editorconfig, make tasks, and devcontainer.

Inheritance
- Read ../core/Repo_Mega_Prompt.txt and ../core/World_Class_Blueprint.txt first.
- Apply constraints, SLOs, and security rules. This prompt takes precedence where more specific.
- Respect Google Sheets as the initial system of record and keep the path open for Postgres.

Operating rules
1) One PR at a time with unified diffs and exact commands. No prose beyond the required sections.
2) Keep changes surgical and reversible. Include rollback notes if risky.
3) No secrets in client or code. Use environment variables and Script Properties.
4) Maintain ASCII only output.
5) Stop after producing diffs and commands for this PR.

Deliverables
- Pre-commit hooks for lint and format
- Makefile or justfile for common tasks
- Devcontainer for one command bootstrap

Task routing within this principle
- Editor and lint settings
- Task runner
- Environment bootstrap

PR plan
- PR 1: Add pre-commit for ruff, black or prettier, eslint
- PR 2: Add Makefile with setup, lint, typecheck, test targets
- PR 3: Add devcontainer config for agent and gui

Acceptance gates
- Fresh clone to dev in under 10 minutes
- One command runs lint, typecheck, and tests

KPIs and budgets
- Build time under 8 minutes
- Test time under 6 minutes

Risks and rollback
- Tooling conflicts. Mitigate with pinned versions
- Local env drift. Mitigate with devcontainer

Output format the agent must follow
- Section A: PR title and rationale
- Section B: Files changed list
- Section C: Unified diff
- Section D: Commands to apply and to run checks
- Section E: Rollback steps
- Section F: Acceptance checks to verify

Defaults when information is missing
- Choose best practice defaults from the core blueprint and prompts.
- Prefer reversible changes. Provide options when in doubt.
